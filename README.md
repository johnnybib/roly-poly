# Roly Poly
Spaghetti Yeti's Submission for the 2021 Global Game Jam!


## The Game

It’s hard being a bug. It’s even harder being a bug that needs to retrieve your eggs from the depths of a dangerous cavern.. Roly Poly is a “Metroidvania” style game where you need to do exactly that. Bounce, boost and blast your way through the cave, unlocking new powers as you go. Grab your egg and escape the level before you both end up cooked!
